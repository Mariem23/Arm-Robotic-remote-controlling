## Remote Robotic Arm 

#### Description
- This repo is the seed for remote arm controlling applications and should be seen as a starting point for future development

- The code contain two sections each part can run alone but together they complete the work flow `each section had a README file`

#### Requirements
- Arduino software and hardware knowledge 
- knowledge of ESPs basics
- c language

#### Setup the code
    you can run all code samples by opening and runing the code in an arduino ide
- `Codes ESP+ Arduino ` folder contain the application actual code
    
    - Arduino follow hand movement and send data to robotic arm receiver
    
    - Robotic arm module controlling module: receive code and rotate motors

- `ESP Code` contain code simples to control a robotic arm and setup a wifi connection between two esp modules
